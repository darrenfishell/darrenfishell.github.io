title: Susan Collins dominated fundraising, but not in Maine
---
From individual donors, incumbent Sen. Susan Collins received two of every $10 from people outside of Maine, according to the latest campaign finance reports.

Collins continued to outraise the rest of her challengers, but not in Maine. Democratic Maine Speaker of the House Sara Gideon, who has won the early backing of the party establishment, raised nearly three times Collins' haul from Maine, in the latest quarter.
