title: A political geography of Maine, or how winning truck town wasn't enough for Shawn Moody
---
After a rough election for Republicans in Maine, it appears they might have a statewide electoral problem: winning truck town is not enough.

Election returns and a database of vehicle registrations by town show Republican gubernatorial candidate Shawn Moody relied heavily on towns where the Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra are the most popular vehicles.

Almost 9 in 10 votes for Moody came from such towns; he won 3 in 4 towns where a truck is the most popular vehicle.

### Cut too thin to win
Moody's vote margins in truck country were relatively thin, when compared with the lead Democratic Gov. Janet Mills amassed in Subaru country.

In places where the Subaru Forester is the most popular vehicle, Mills defeated Moody nearly 65:1; meanwhile, Moody had just less than a 3:1 lead on Mills in Chevy Silverado towns, where he won most of his votes.

Overall, Mills performed better in truck towns than Moody did in places where other vehicles are the most popular. In truck country, Mills lagged Moody by about 21,600 votes. Moody fell behind by about 69,000 votes where other vehicles were the most popular choice.

### What does your vehicle say about your partisan leanings?

The data points to some general trends in the partisan lean of specific vehicles.

For this analysis, I winnowed the data down to a pairing of an election winner and the most popular local vehicle -- a process that largely involved cleaning and standardizing model names from the vehicle registration data (thank you very much, [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)).

The result allows us to see how towns voted, broken out by the most popular local vehicle.

While trucks emerged as a clear division in the results, there was one major outlier (which you might suspect): the Toyota Tacoma. Mills and Moody both won 3 Tacoma towns each, making it the most bipartisan Maine vehicle.

By make, GMC and Chevy towns leaned heavily Republican. Subarus leaned way to the left (with the exceptions of Woolwich and Kingfield).

The graphic below shows those fault lines in more detail. For instance, you can see the Silverado towns that went for Mills and the Toyota Camry towns that went for Moody.

### Data accounting
The analysis leaves some data on the cutting room floor, but ultimately accounts for more than 98 percent of all vehicle registrations and votes cast in the 2018 gubernatorial election. The vehicle registration data was captured before the election, as of Sept. 18, 2018, by request to the Maine Secretary of State's Office.

The analysis excludes towns where there was no clear top vehicle — ties of 1–1, for instance — and overseas votes.
