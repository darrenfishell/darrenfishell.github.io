Want to know exactly where Central Maine Power Co. plans to weave its controversial power line through the state? Maine's Department of Environmental Protection has the answer.

As the DEP reviews the New England Clean Energy Connect project, the agency has published detailed maps of the proposed project area and individual structures for two power lines -- one from the Canadian border to Lewiston and another from Windsor to Wiscasset.

The maps give a much higher level of detail than maps published, for example, [at the website for the project](https://www.necleanenergyconnect.org/map/).<figure style="text-align:right;"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59f503f2d74cff2410953bcf/t/5b5b6db2aa4a99c5ff5c4bd3/1535048016348/NECEC_map.png?format=1000w" style="padding:10px; text-align:right;" width="150px"><figcaption>The map featured at the NECEC project's website.</figcaption></figure>
