title: Track Maine coronavirus trends by ZIP code
---
COVID-19 cases have been on a sharp rise in Maine even before identification of the first cases of the new Omicron variant in the state.

This increase is present in most areas of the state, according to local data from the Maine CDC. The state CDC has regularly published ZIP-code level data on cases for some of the state's more populous communities (areas with populations over 2,000).

The visualizations below reflect the collection of reports issued approximately weekly by ZIP code, with some weeks of data excluded from the trend chart to ensure completeness.
