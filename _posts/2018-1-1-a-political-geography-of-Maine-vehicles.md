### Findings
--Shawn Moody won more than 3 in 4 towns where a truck or SUV was the most popular vehicle, by total registrations, landing the most towns where the Ford F-150 reigns.
--Janet Mills handily won Subaru country, taking about 9 in 10 towns where either the Outback, Forester or Legacy were the most popular car. Mills won more Forester towns than any other.
--For trucks, the the Toyota Tacoma is an outlier. Mills won 5 Tacoma towns to Moody's 3. That was not true for Toyota's Rav4; Moody won more Rav4 towns.


Data accounting:
The blend of data leaves some communities on the cutting room floor, considering communities that make up about 1,140,696 of 1,171,069 vehicles statewide, or about 97 percent of vehicles. It also includes about 96 percent of the total vote.

This excludes towns where the top vehicle title was a tossup, sometimes shared between the Chevy Silverado and the Subaru Forester.
