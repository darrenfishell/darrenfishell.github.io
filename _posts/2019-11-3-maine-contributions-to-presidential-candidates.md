title: See the 2020 candidates hauling in the most cash from Maine donors
---
Vermont Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders has so far pulled in the most money from individual contributors in Maine, where in 2016 he won the party caucus.

FEC data shows Sanders pulled in more than `$131,000` from 504 contributors who have given his campaign more than $200 so far (campaigns do not have to disclose the addresses of donors giving smaller amounts).

Sanders is the only Democrat who has raised more in Maine than Republican incumbent Donald Trump.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttegieg raised the next highest amounts in Maine.

Trump had a significant head start, with individual donations from Maine starting to flow steadily in late 2018.
