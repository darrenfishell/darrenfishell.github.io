title: Droning misty fall foliage over Maine's Dead River
---

Last weekend camping near the Dead River was a bit foggy and mostly cloudy, but when bits of sunshine came through, it was beautiful, especially from 400 feet up. 

I joined colleague [Troy R. Bennett](http://mysteryjig.com) for an annual Ural motorcycle rally, where a few owners of the Russian-made sidecar bikes (and two two-wheelers this year) gather for adventures on the backroads and logging roads of Maine. It's a lot of fun and brings together a pretty eclectic group.

Troy edited the above video, with a little of my filming help out of the sidecar and from the Airship Sancho, my DJI Phantom 3 drone. It was the Airship's first real mission of 2017 and it performed admirably. 

In addition to notes from the margins of the data reporting notebook, drones will be a somewhat regular feature here, too.
