title: Consultants and others chime in on Maine marijuana rulemaking
---

After some insisting, Maine state government published recommendations from consultants and others about rulemaking on the road to legalizing marijuana. 

Responses ranged from the Maine Centers for Disease Control to cannabis tech firm Weedmaps. The responses shed some light on the earliest back-and-forth over rulemaking, while others hoping to get a piece of the legalization pie scoop up real estate. 

Check out the responses below. Maine's Department of Administrative and Financial Services also [published responses at their site](http://www.maine.gov/dafs/services/marijuana/rfi/index.html) and made them [available for bulk download](http://www.maine.gov/dafs/services/marijuana/rfi/responses/RFI_and_Responses.zip), in case you want your own copies.
