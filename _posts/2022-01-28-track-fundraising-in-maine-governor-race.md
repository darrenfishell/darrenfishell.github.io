title: Track contributions to Maine's gubernatorial candidates
---
Election season is all up on us. Again. It's an off-cycle year, the last two years have been a blur: it's hard to believe. But it's back -- and so is former Gov. Paul LePage ([see Maine's term limits](https://www.maine.gov/legis/const/#a5)).

The candidates disclosed their first big batch of fundraising earlier this month, with the contest so far dominated by Democratic incumbent Janet Mills and the returning Paul LePage. Republican (anti-gay activist) Michael Heath is also in the mix.

Democrats John Glowa and and Kenneth Capron have also reported small contributions, as has Green Independent candidate Michael Barden.

As of now, there's not been any outside spending in the race, but that will be incorporated here when the time comes.
