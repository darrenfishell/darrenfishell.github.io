title: Cash to Maine legislative candidates jumps 50% from 2020 
---
Maine's first post-vaccine legislative contests brought on a 50 percent leap in campaign contributions and spending, according to the latest campaign finance records available before Election Day.

Contributions and outside spending topped $12 million for Maine's House and Senate candidates, up from just over $8 million in 2020.

The leap was fueled by a number of competitive races. The most hotly contested is in Maine's northernmost Senate district, where Senate President Troy Jackson (D-Allagash) is facing off against Rep. Sue Bernard (R-Caribou). 

That race, where both candidates have used the state's public campaign financing system has attracted just over $1.1 million.

In the House, the highest-cost race is district 57, including Readfield, Belgrade and Monmouth, in the race between Wilson Corey (R) and Tavis Rock Hasenfus (D).
