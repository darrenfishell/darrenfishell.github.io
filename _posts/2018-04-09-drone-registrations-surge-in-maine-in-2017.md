The figures show that the number of drones more than doubled over the year in Maine's most populated areas. Drone registrations nearly tripled in Lewiston, while rising roughly 150 percent in Portland, Bangor and Auburn. 

The data, recorded at the ZIP code level, showed the Portland area added more drones than anywhere else, followed by the Bangor area and then a group of other southern Maine towns.
