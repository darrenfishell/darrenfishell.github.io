title: Maine's electorate is getting more divided. See how your town is split.
---
After President Donald J. Trump's election, Maine quickly became more partisan than it had been for a decade.

The share of voters not enrolled in a political party hit a 10-year low last year, thanks to a gradual rise in third-party voter registrations and others coming off the sidelines to join two of the major political parties.

In most ways, that's expected. In 2008, following Democratic President Barack Obama's election, unenrolled voter registrations dropped as Republican voter registration climbed.

But there's a clear shift after Trump's election in 2016: third-party registrations stalled as the ranks of registered Democrats and Republicans rose across the state.

In your town, perhaps the product of that increasing partisanship is visible: bumper stickers or hats or giant lawn signs out to enjoy a victory lap.

That's most likely the case in Southern Maine communities like Gorham and Topsham, two of the largest communities where both Democrats and Republicans gained a greater share of local registered voters after Trump's election.

That wasn't uncommon for 2018. More than `45 percent` of registered Maine voters lived in communities where the partisan divide widened.

Two years after Obama's election, in 2010, `35 percent` of Maine voters lived in such districts, while almost `55 percent` lived in areas that swung more Republican.

While voter registration trends have been lopsided in favor of Democrats, they don't look quite like that from 2016 to 2018, as a widening partisan divide better characterizes local trends than a swing to the left, despite overall Democratic gains statewide.

That picture varies widely at the local level. For instance, the Trumpiest community in the state, Magalloway Plantation, became less partisan in 2018, with a sharp decline in Republican registration and a rise in unenrolled voters, which now make up `54 percent` of local voters.
