title: Part I&#58; Data sources local reporters should know about
---

Before a reporter contacts any source, they need to understand why that person's in a position to know the answer to their question.

The same goes for data. So, the first step in data reporting is getting an introduction to some of the kinds of data that know things about your local beat, your county or state.

And there's plenty here for reporters on local beats to dig into. I think you'll be surprised at the kinds of insights you can extract at the local level, particularly because _not many other people are looking there._

That makes this kind of reporting good hunting ground for scoops, but it also empowers reporters to put hard facts up against rhetoric. It makes for strong follow-up questions and for a better understanding of the community you cover.

So, in super broad strokes, here are some federal data sources that can tell you about your community.

### American Community Survey comparative tables

The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey runs deep. For that, it's a data source that can be supremely confusing.

The bureau unraveled some of that confusion in a series of four tables that show you, very simply, what's up and what's down in a given area -- including quite small cities and towns.

At a glance, the tables show you where demographers think there's been a significant change in that community. Is it getting older? Richer? Are there more vacant housing units? What's happened to the share of people with health insurance?

There's a ton here that could very well intersect with discussions in local or state government, which makes it a great place to start. And it's a good introduction to the survey and its [FactFinder website](http://factfinder.census.gov/), which you should come to consider a familiar friend.

The tables can be a little confusing to find. Here's how.

1. Navigate to  FactFinder's `Advanced Search` page, on the top navigation bar. If you do more inquiring of the ACS, you should become familiar with this page, which _isn't as scary as it may look_.

In general, the page lets you place filters on all of the data ACS keeps, narrowing down the topics and geographies you want.
