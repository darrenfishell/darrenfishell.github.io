### Findings
-- Moody won more than 8 in every 10 towns where a truck or SUV is the most popular vehicle: He won 77 towns where the Chevy 1500 is the most popular vehicle, picking up 9 in 10 of those towns.
-- The Toyota Tacoma does lean Democratic: Mills won 8 towns where that truck is the most popular vehicle, against 5 for Moody.
-- Mills found truck country backing in a large part of the Midcoast, northern border communities in Aroostook County and select parts of western Maine.
-- Mills won the most communities where Subaru Foresters are the most popular vehicle, but the split for Foresters is less partisan than Subaru Outback communities: Mills won 7 of 10 Forester towns; she won more than 9 in 10 Outback towns.
-- Toyota vehicles, in general, had less partisan affinity: Mills won 14 towns where the Toyota Camry is most popular; Moody won 12. Only the Ford Focus split more evenly, but across fewer towns -- each candidate picked up one town where the Focus is favored.
