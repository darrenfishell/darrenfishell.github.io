To answer that question, it helps to have some familiarity with the available data tools, to know just how you might get from raw data to some conclusion or a publishable graphic.

There are plenty of tools that can help, without any coding.

The best single tool I've found is [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/), which is free to download and publish to the web. That has been the backbone of most of the data journalism I've done, with no coding required.

Here's an example (for which you can download Tableau Public and follow along), where we'll take a somewhat frightening data set and distill it down to something more palatable.
