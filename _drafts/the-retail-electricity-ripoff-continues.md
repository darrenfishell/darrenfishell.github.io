title: Let's count all the things Maine could have instead of an electricity ripoff
---
Imagine three turkeys on every Thanksgiving table in Maine.

That's approximately the cost of seven years of an electricity ripoff for residential power customers in Maine.

The ripoff doesn't come from utilities like Central Maine Power Co. or Emera Maine, but electricity supply companies that use utility power lines and utility billing systems to reach their customers.

These retail power suppliers have now charged Maine residential power customers at least $132 million _over_ the default price for power, set annually by state regulators.

In other words, money that Maine's residential customers did not need to spend in order to receive electricity to their homes.

That amount translates to almost the cost of three organic, 15-pound turkeys for every household in Maine; or, 9 live lobsters for every person in the state; or, five months of electricity for every home; or, more than two of Central Maine Power Co.'s faulty and controversial billing systems.

### Mounting costs

Retail power suppliers are on the decline. From a peak of about 221,000 customers in July 2012, their enrollment has fallen by more than half.

As a result, the total amount residential customers are spending over the standard power price has dwindled. But it's still a significant amount.

Last year alone, that amount was $20.4 million. Including an estimate for small businesses adds another $4.3 million.

Retail power suppliers in Maine are loosely regulated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

The commission maintains and enforces rules about how those suppliers can market their product, for example.

Maine's largest retail supplier, the homegrown Electricity Maine, is now under scrutiny for its use of door-to-door marketing through independent contractors.





companies -- in theory -- compete with a power price set each year when large regional power generators bid to serve the default power option in Maine, called the "standard offer."

That's the price that retail suppliers, like Electricity Maine, initially strived to beat.

They include homegrown companies like Electricity Maine


which has siphoned roughly $84 million from residential customers
