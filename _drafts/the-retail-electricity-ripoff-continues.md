title: Let's count all the things Maine could have instead of an electricity ripoff
---
Every table in Maine could have three plump, 15-pound organic turkeys this Thanksgiving, for the price of an electricity ripoff that's now in its seventh year.

In other words, Maine's residential power customers could have saved $132.5 million since 2012 if they'd only done nothing with their power supply and taken the default service price, according to analysis of annual reports filed with the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

It has not been reported that the sum rose another $20 million last year.

The amount is even higher when estimated with state power usage data, which groups together homes and small businesses. Retail suppliers typically charge the same rates to customers in that class, whether residential or business.

Customers, in most cases, have been duped. How else do you convince someone to pay more for something that they already have?

It's that kind of duplicity that prompted the state advocate for electricity customers -- called the Public Advocate -- to recommend a one-year suspension and a $1 million fine against the state's largest private electricity supplier, Electricity Maine.

And the ripoff has little to do with the barrage of attention on Central Maine Power Co.'s billing system, which the public advocate says continues to issue incorrect bills to thousands of customers. It's unclear how many of the customers who faced steep increases in late 2017 received their electricity supply from suppliers like Electricity Maine.

By comparison, the amount residential customers have lost to private electricity sellers could have paid for all of CMP's billing system, twice.

And there'd still be enough left to buy a 15-pound organic turkey for every residential customer that lost out.

### After years of silence, a founder speaks up and shits on findings

I first reported on Maine's retail electricity ripoff three years ago, for the _[Bangor Daily News](https://bangordailynews.com/2016/08/31/the-point/how-electricity-providers-siphoned-more-than-20m-from-maine-customers/)._

At the time, data from 2012-2014 showed residential customers spent about $18 million over the default price by going with retail suppliers.

As the total kept climbing in 2017, [Maine's legislature passed a new consumer protection law](https://bangordailynews.com/2017/05/23/politics/leading-edge-restrictions-on-electricity-sellers-become-maine-law/) and the number of customers getting power from retail suppliers continued to fall.

But, new law in hand, the amount sucked out of the pockets of residential customers in Maine for electricity supply is now more than seven times the amount reported in 2016.

Electricity Maine, a company actually founded in the state, has dominated Maine's residential supply market since it pioneered the idea here in late 2011, when it beat the default rate for power, called the standard offer. By 2012, it had amassed more than 100,000 customers.

Before my first story was published, I called and emailed Electricity Maine's co-founders multiple times, over a period of weeks. I provided the gist of my findings by email and voicemail. But nothing.

It seemed that perhaps the silence was a product of timing: The duo was in the middle of cashing out, to the Texas-based Spark Energy, and Spark retained both as consultants to the new owner for a year.

Last year, more details emerged about the difficulties Electricity Maine faced then. By 2015, it was operating in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, too, under the holding company Provider Power.

In a court document, Electricity Maine co-founder Kevin Dean said ["the power comapnies had losses of over $14,000,000 and were in trouble" in 2015](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/05/22/mainefocus/while-electricity-maine-overcharged-customers-millions-it-was-still-losing-money/).

Industry experts I spoke with during my coverage wondered how Electricity Maine and others could find any profit in the razor thin margin while trying to beat the standard offer and spending on overhead and acquiring new customers (at [a price as high as $80 per customer](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2998320-Spark-Energy-purchase-agreement-for-Provider-Power.html#document/p6/a311766), according to an estimate by Electricity Maine buyer, Spark).

After years with no public comment on how much the company siphoned from its residential customers, Electricity Maine co-founder Clavet finally spoke in July, in a deposition.

He dismissed the findings I published and that were later confirmed and published in a report by Maine's Public Utilities Commission.

"I don't think it's a valuable report," Clavet said. "I think it's an incomplete picture."

He objected to comparisons with the standard offer, echoing an industry line that retail supplier plans can have different characteristics, contract lengths and perks.

It's less compelling when considering that, in 2011, the same Clavet [said](https://perma.cc/W2U7-UFH7): "We will always beat the standard offer. You’ll never, ever pay more than the standard offer, or we won’t be back."

### Others knew and so did Electricity Maine

Clavet's promise has a long, hollow echo.

That's because Electricity Maine knew in 2013 that the standard offer was changing and that they'd not be able to beat it anymore.

"The way that they procure standard offer changed so we were competing with a different product," Clavet said in July. "We would compare ourselves to standard offer for different reasons at different times because standard offer was evolving and changing continuously."

The lesson appears to be: never say never.

Electricity Maine stayed in the game and changed its tactics, shifting marketing to emphasize being a local, Auburn-based company that supported area nonprofits. They quietly re-enrolled existing customers at higher rates, sending emails that might end up in a spam folder.

Meanwhile, supplier Dead River Co., which had a base of existing home heating customers to keep happy, saw the writing on the wall and bowed out, doing exactly what Clavet said Electricity Maine would do.

Dead River's letter starts:

>In October 2012, we entered the electricity supply business to offer our customers an electric thermal
electricity supply rate that was _less than_ the Standard Offer -- saving you approximately 6% on your
electricity supply bill.

>Since then, the escalating cost of natural gas has contributed to the increased cost of electricity. As a
result, many electricity supply providers increased their rates to levels above the Standard Offer, costing consumers more on their energy bills. Dead River Company upheld its promise to offer you savings by keeping our rates below the Standard Offer.

Dead River announced it would end its service in December 2014, when customers would transition back to the standard offer.

Since 2013, the Electricity Maine's average residential price has been higher than the standard offer each year, based on its year-end revenue and power supplied. In 2015, its price was `66%` higher. Last year, it was `44%`.

<iframe style="border: none; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/retail-power-premium-workbook/Thecostofretailpowersupply?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="635px"></iframe>

But now, with the standard offer at a new high, Electricity Maine's 12-month plan is back to beating the standard offer, at the moment, saving the average home $5 a month. The price includes some uncertainty, as the standard offer changes every year and will again on Jan. 1, 2020. A customer signing up now could get stung if the standard offer dropped substantially on Jan. 1.

Should you face buyer's remorse price dip, there's a $100 fee for cancelling an Electricity Maine contract early.

It gets more complicated still. Electricity Maine also offers a range of different plans for different terms: a six-month option, an 18-month option and a 24-month option.

In his deposition, Clavet argues those kinds of details provide value that's not included in a straight comparison with the standard offer. What value do you place on knowing that a price will stay the same for 24 months, compared with a price that will change in 12?

But Electricity Maine's early ads made exactly that comparison. In 2013, they touted saving customers around $7 million, a calculation they said was based on [description].

[Clavet also stated that his company did not view its prices as an average among all of its customers of a certain class. But if that's not a lie, it's very close to one.]

[That's because Clavet was set to be paid from Electricity Maine's buyer based [on exactly that number](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2998320-Spark-Energy-purchase-agreement-for-Provider-Power.html#document/p6/a524926). The agreement provided a bonus to Clavet and Dean based on the number of customers and the average rate they paid.]

[Clavet said "You can't take a twelve-month contract or a 24-month contract and only put a year of it in here and have it be relative to others that your're comparing that might have been built with six-month and then twelve-month or one-month variable contracts."]

Other retail supply plans can vary in other ways. For instance, they can have "clean power" attributes, whether the contract is actually backed by a renewable energy project or whether the premium just pays for the cost of renewable energy credits.

Public reporting and industry groups have declined to disclose just how many of their customers choose such plans, as opposed to the customers who are signing up based on price.

The record, however, shows what Electricity Maine thinks is fair in making price comparisons: when their price is lower, it's the leading line; when their price is higher, one must consider the value they add.

That begs the one question I'd have liked Clavet to answer for me all along: if _he_ can't make a fair comparison between the standard offer and supply from companies like Electricity Maine, how the hell can the average customer?
