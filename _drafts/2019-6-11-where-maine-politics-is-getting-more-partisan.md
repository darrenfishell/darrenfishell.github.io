title: Maine's electorate is getting more divided. See how your town is split.

After President Donald J. Trump's election, Maine's partisan divide grew to its widest in a decade.

The share of unenrolled voters hit a 10-year low, as voters shifted to third parties and others came off the sidelines to join one of the two major political parties.

In some ways, that's expected. The president's party [most often loses seats in the House of Representatives](https://news.gallup.com/poll/242093/midterm-seat-loss-averages-unpopular-presidents.aspx) during the following mid-term election. But Trump's election didn't play out in the same way in Maine.

In 2010, following Democratic President Barack Obama's election two years prior, voter registration almost everywhere in Maine went _way red._ Every county but Knox got redder.

After Trump, however, the state split almost down the middle: Republican voter registration gains outpaced that of Democrats in half of counties.

Go more local and the contrast is even starker: After Obama, there was backlash in 96 Maine House districts that became redder; after Trump, the split couldn't have been more even, with 59 districts getting bluer and 58 getting redder.

Trends in voter registration data from the Maine Secretary of State's Office reveals emerging fault lines in Maine politics that followed Trump's election.

Those trends don't necessarily indicate who is going to win at the polls. Democrats still hold a voter registration advantage, with `33.1%` of the vote, to Republicans' `27.3%`, in 2018. Democrats swept in state elections, taking over the Blaine House and both chambers of the Legislature.

But there appears a line in the sand where voters have made their choice: Androscoggin, Kennebec and Penobscot counties all continued to get redder while inland Franklin County and every coastal county but for Washington County got bluer.

But there's a clear shift after Trump's election in 2016: third-party registrations stalled as the ranks of registered Democrats and Republicans rose across the state.

In your town, perhaps the product of that increasing partisanship is visible: bumper stickers or hats or giant lawn signs out to enjoy a victory lap.

That's most likely the case in Southern Maine communities like Gorham and Topsham, two of the largest communities where both Democrats and Republicans gained a greater share of local registered voters after Trump's election.

That wasn't uncommon for 2018. More than `45 percent` of registered Maine voters lived in communities where the partisan divide widened.

[How partisanship shifted post-Trump]

Two years after Obama's election, in 2010, `35 percent` of Maine voters lived in such districts, while almost `55 percent` lived in areas that swung more Republican.

While voter registration trends have been lopsided in favor of Democrats, they don't look quite like that from 2016 to 2018, as a widening partisan divide better characterizes local trends than a swing to the left, despite overall Democratic gains statewide.

That picture varies widely at the local level. For instance, the Trumpiest community in the state, Magalloway Plantation, became less partisan in 2018, with a sharp decline in Republican registration and a rise in unenrolled voters, which now make up `54 percent` of local voters.
