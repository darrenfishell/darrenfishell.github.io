title: Maine's electorate is getting more divided. See how your town is split.
---
Maine's electorate is more partisan than any time in the last decade, with a gap that has widened between Maine's coastal and inland counties after the election of Republican President Donald Trump.

What's curious about that trend: it wasn't so after President Barack Obama's election, when all but Knox county swung to the right.

The trends in voter registration from the Maine Secretary of State's Office reveal growing fault lines in Maine politics that have a distinct geographic pattern and show where partisanship is most likely to hit home.

_Follow the key takeaways in the interactive below._

<p>1. In 2010, following Democratic President Barack Obama's election two years prior, voter registration almost everywhere in Maine went _way red._ Every county but Knox got redder. After Trump, however, the state split almost down the middle: Republican voter registration gains outpaced that of Democrats in half of counties.</p>
<p>2. Go more local and the contrast is even starker: After Obama, 96 Maine House districts became redder; after Trump, the split couldn't have been more even, with 59 districts getting bluer and 58 getting redder.</p>
<p>3. At the municipal level, Democrats gained on Republicans in more populous areas, winning a greater share of registered voters in towns representing about `565,000` voters, in 2018. Democrats gained on Republicans in `170 communities`; Republicans gained in `263 communities`.</p>

### Voters are picking a lane

[Backlash against a newly elected president is typical](https://news.gallup.com/poll/242093/midterm-seat-loss-averages-unpopular-presidents.aspx), but trends in voter registration suggest that something different is happening in Maine after the election of Donald Trump: Many parts of the state are doubling down on their beliefs.

A voter _could_ register for a party for a number of different reasons. This analysis views that decision as a marker of party identification: simply, someone deciding I _am_ a Democrat/Republican/[Vermin Supreme voter](https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/vermin-supreme-makes-his-2020-bid-for-the-libertarian-party-presidential-nomination).

The trends don't reflect who's going to win an election, but rather affinity for one party or another.

By outright numbers, Democrats continue to wield an advantage that helped them to victories at the Blaine House, the Legislature and Maine's 2nd Congressional District.

But underneath that, Republicans continued to gain a greater share of the electorate in 2018, as unenrolled voters dropped off dramatically and third-party registrations hit a standstill.

### Local impact

In your town, perhaps the product of that increasing partisanship is visible: bumper stickers or hats or giant lawn signs parading victory.

Communities including Gorham and Auburn are among the largest communities where both Democrats and Republicans gained a greater share of local registered voters after Trump's election.

And that was fairly common in 2018. More than `45%` of registered Maine voters lived in communities where the partisan divide widened.

Two years after Obama's election, `35%` of voters lived in areas where that divide increased (`52%` of Maine voters lived in areas that swung Republican).

By county, the post-Trump trend is almost a stereotype: every coastal county except Washington got bluer, as did Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' home turf, Franklin County. Eight other counties got redder.

But even Cumberland and York County got redder after Obama's election. The reverse did not happen after Trump landed in office.

And while Cumberland and York did get bluer, the local trend shows something different: Towns in the western parts of those counties only got more divided, with Democrats _and_ Republicans gaining shares of registered voters.

Androscoggin, Kennebec and Penobscot -- the third-, fourth- and fifth-most populous counties -- all became redder.

That picture in those counties varies widely at the local level, too. For instance, the [Trumpiest community in the state](http://widgetsanddigits.bangordailynews.com/2017/02/26/economy/how-trumpy-is-your-town/), Magalloway Plantation, became less partisan in 2018, with a sharp decline in Republican registration and a rise in unenrolled voters, which now make up `54%` of local voters.
