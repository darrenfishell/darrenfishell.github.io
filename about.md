I'm a data visualization analyst, freelance reporter and data scientist in training, based in Portland, Maine. I was previously a full-time investigative and business reporter.

I grew up in the suburb of [Diamond Bar, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Bar,_California), before coming to Maine [for college](http://bowdoin.edu) and staying in Portland. I started my journalism career as the first local editor for [Patch.com](https://patch.com/users/darren-fishell) in my hometown. I came back to Maine for a staff job at a small, [afternoon daily paper](http://timesrecord.com) in Brunswick. I grew a fondness for data reporting at [Mainebiz](http://mainebiz.com) before three years covering Maine's economy and investigations at the [Bangor Daily News](http://bangordailynews.com).

I now work for [Arkatechture](https://www.arkatechture.com/), a data consulting firm with offices on Portland's East End. I'm also a master's student at the Roux Institute, a Portland-based program of Northeastern University.

As a reporter, I contribute to the nonprofit Maine Monitor and Mainer.
