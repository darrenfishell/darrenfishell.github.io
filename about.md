I'm an investigative and data reporter on the Bangor Daily News' [Maine Focus](http://bangordailynews.com/mainefocus/) team. 

I grew up in the suburb of [Diamond Bar, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Bar,_California), before coming to Maine [for college](http://bowdoin.edu) and staying in Portland. Professionally, I spent a year as the first local editor for [Patch.com](https://patch.com/users/darren-fishell) in my hometown but came back to Maine for a reporting job at a small, [afternoon daily paper](http://timesrecord.com) in Brunswick. Landed next at [Mainebiz](http://mainebiz.com) before three years covering business, Maine's economy and energy for the [Bangor Daily News](http://bangordailynews.com). I joined the MaineFocus team in September 2017.
