I'm a business intelligence manager and data scientist based in Portland, Maine. I previously worked as an investigative, business and general assignment reporter at publications in Maine and California.

I grew up in the suburb of [Diamond Bar, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Bar,_California), before coming to Maine [for college](http://bowdoin.edu) and staying in Portland. I started my journalism career as the first local editor for [Patch.com](https://patch.com/users/darren-fishell) in my hometown. I came back to Maine for a staff job at a small, [afternoon daily paper](http://timesrecord.com) in Brunswick. I grew a fondness for data reporting at [Mainebiz](http://mainebiz.com) before three years covering Maine's economy and investigations at the [Bangor Daily News](http://bangordailynews.com).

Witnessing some live data science and statistics wizardry one election night at the Bangor Daily News (when the paper had a data scientist on staff!) fascinated me and pushed me in a new direction.

I currently manage business intelligence tools for the accounting firm [Baker Newman Noyes](https://www.bnncpa.com/). I'm also a master's student at the Roux Institute, a Portland-based program of Northeastern University.

As a freelance reporter, I've contributed to the nonprofit Maine Monitor and Mainer. The electricity price [ripoff of competitive electricity providers](https://themainemonitor.org/private-electricity-suppliers-cost-mainers-132-million-more-than-necessary/) is my particular bone to pick.
